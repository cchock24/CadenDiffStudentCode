| Feb 24  |  2:20-3:00   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Talked to Diego and tried to work the problem out on the board |
| Feb 25  | 10:00-10:20  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I was trying to brainstorm what to do I started to experiment with 4 recursive calls instead of 2 for both words, but got interrupted halfway bc I realized I had a math test. |
| Feb 26  | 12:40 - 1:45 | Made a program based on what we discussed yesterday. Initially had problems with stackoverflow due to an error with my recursive calls. Then had a indexoutof bounds error also linked to the base case. Fixed both my codes works with all the test cases, but is really slow I suspect it is either because my saved table isn't filling correctly or becase of indexof/substring. So my next step is to try and find a why to not use them. |
| Feb 28  | 12:00-12:50  |                                                            Went to the debugger to try and observe how the table was filling and realized it wasn't really filling correctly, so tried working with that, but then I realized I could also try removing the indexof/substring. I ended up realizing there wasn't a need to do it because at the step it will either be included or not and that I can still go through all the letters anyways |

I finished the problem and I think my runtime is pretty good too |
